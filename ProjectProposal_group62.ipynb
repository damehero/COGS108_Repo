    "As college students on track to graduation, we wanted to understand if acquiring a job with a high salary would require one to relocate to a different state. Although we currently know that there are certain regions that are known to be ideal for certain career paths (i.e. Silicon Valley for majors related to technology), we wanted to analyze further in-depth about other locations that are ideal for other majors. After doing further research on another project that analyzed the correlation between salaries and the value of having a college degree, we wanted to analyze if salaries depended on geographical location. People have made general calculators (i.e. PayScale.com), which makes estimations on salaries that individuals earn based on factors such as the alma matter or university in which they received their degree from. We wanted to go the extra mile and further investigate this question by taking into account living costs of certain regions and how it pays off.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has also led us to ponder into the discussion of where the next Tech Hub might emerge from. As we know today, Silicon Valley is the most popular center for innovation and tech startups. In fact, most of the unicorn companies (companies valued over a billion dollars) all come from there. So we wondered, why do entrepreneurs and technologists yearn to settle at that location when looking for a career? Why did leading companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook all start in Silicon Valley? Were those companies started by college students who went to colleges proximal to Silicon Valley (i.e. Stanford and UC Berkeley)? We wanted to find out if any of these factors actually contributed to the success and image of Silicon Valley and how we could have insight to where the next Silicon Valley might be. From ‘builtin.com’, it shows that San Francisco has only 4,346 tech companies and is the third most expensive city to live in, while New York City has 5,196 tech companies and is the second most expensive city to live in. Garnering examples like these spark insight and test our assumptions about these locations.\n",

    "An ideal dataset would cover all the discrepancies we’re seeking to address with this research question. Since our question is about the city mostly, we need geographic-specific data that will tell us the average pay in a city for a given career and the ability to address the fact that living costs heavily factor into the true value of the salary in any given place since the living costs can shift drastically from city to city. Additionally this data would have to be collected on a national level and consistent regardless of location. In order to do this, we have to find a national provider of data that rates all cities by the same metric such as a tourism or housing service. Also data about the average pay of a career nationally would help us place greater weight on whether the salary increase is worth it regardless of the living costs. Since we are looking at several different majors which have to be treated independently, we will need a great number of observations for each given major/career path with little overlap allowed for similar fields that connotes similar pay (i.e. anything careers in similar sectors Graphic Designer <-> UI designer). To summarize, the data we collect should be able to be matched by city or state, while allowing us to make a correlation between the growth rate of certain areas to the relationship between geo-specific salary and living costs in order to establish a ranking system of best places to go with a given major/career path. \n",

    "As with any form of data investigation, certain precautions and best-practice procedures must be followed in order to adhere to ethical and privacy standards. By using datasets that have been generated by reputable sources (US Census Bureau, Department of Labor & Commerce, WSJ) we have ensured to the best of our ability that the data being used in our project was collected in an equitable and consensual manner. The datasets we have chosen are public and free to use on our project, and don't seem to interfere with our purposes.\n",
    " \n",
    "Additionally, because we are drawing from such a general and broad range of anonymous statistics, we can naturally avoid violating the privacy of any particular individual. However, there are still certain ethical issues that we must be wary of as we complete our project. A key issue that can arise in our particular project has to do with the biases that already exist in our data. For example, certain datasets may be incomplete or weigh heavily in favor of one category due to convenience sampling. It is our responsibility as data scientists to identify these discrepancies and try to mitigate their impact on our predictions by cross-referencing additional data sources. Something that we must also be conscious of is that we are excluding other universities across the globe, mainly because we want to be specific with our data analyses. Currently, we are only focusing on individuals who have pursued Bachelor degrees, which excludes those who did not get a traditional 4-year degree. This could lead to some biases in our data, but we hope to account for that by narrowing down the population we are examining. "
